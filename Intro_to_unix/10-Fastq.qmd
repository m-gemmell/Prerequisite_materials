# Fastq format
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/files.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
The next exercise will focus on a set of files including fastq files.

- A fastq file is very commonly used in bioinformatics. 
- Fastq files contain the base content and its sequencing quality for sequences. 
- Generally these files are separated by sample but not always.
- A fastq file acts as a normal txt file that can be read but is of a specific format. 
- One fastq file contains many fastq entries, one after the other. 
- Each fastq entry contains four lines. 
    + One fastq entry represents one sequence. 

The format of one entry is as below:

__\@Sequence 1__  
__CTGTTAAATACCGACTTGCGTCAGGTGCGTGAACAACTGGGCCGCTTT__  
__+__  
__=<<<=>\@\@\@ACDCBCDAC\@BAA\@BA\@BBCBBDA\@BB\@>CD\@A\@B?B\@\@__

The lines represent:  
1. Header for fastq entry known as the fastq header. This always begins with a ‘@’.  
2. Sequence content of sequence  
3. Quality header. Always begins with a ‘+’. Sometimes also contains the same information as fastq header.  
4. Quality values for each base in the 2nd line. NOTE: ‘@’ can be used as quality values.
