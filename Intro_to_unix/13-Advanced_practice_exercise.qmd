``` 

1. Copy the directory __~/Linux/advanced_practice__ to __~/Linux/advanced_practice_exercise__
2. Move into __~/Linux/advanced_practice_exercise__
3. Make a directory called __fastq__ and one called __txt__
4. With one command move all the fastq files into the directory __fastq__
5. With one command move all the txt files, excluding __metadata.txt__ and __samples.txt__, into the directory __txt__
6. Create a file in the __fastq__ directory called __patient_1_corrected.fastq__ and put all the corrected fastq data for patient_1 into the file.
7. Append the metadata line for sample_1_AAAA to the bottom of the file __sample_1_AAA.txt__ in the __txt__  directory.
8. For all the corrected fastq files find the sequences that start with a stop codon in the forward orientation (i.e. TAG, TAA or TGA). Print out to screen the sample name and sequence info separated by a “:” only (e.g. sample_10_AAGT:TAAGAGAACAATGAACAGATATTAATAATTTTGCCGCTTTTCTGCGGGAT)
9. Count the number of Gs and Cs within file __sample_16_AACC.fastq__
10. Get the fastq headers of sequences with homopolymers made of As with a length of 5 or greater for the uncorrected fastq files for samples 3,4,5,13,14 and 15 with one command.
