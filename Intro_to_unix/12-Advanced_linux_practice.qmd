knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/linux_intermdiary.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
We have covered a small amount of Linux coding. This should be sufficient to carry out our future workshops but if you were to continue in bioinformatics we would recommend learning more advanced methods.

Below are some short sections to introduce you to some more advanced linux coding techniques. These give you a quick overview and some examples. This will hopefully put you in a good position to allow you to to learn these techniques in more depth outside of this workshop.

The following sections will all be run with the files in the directory __"~/Linux/advanced_practice/"__. Therefore ensure you are in this directory before running the below examples. This contains fastq and txt files for 20 samples. Each sample contains a fastq file and txt file for uncorrected and corrected reads. These fastq files are single end (i.e. there is no reverse/R2 reads).

## Wildcard characters
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/wildcard.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
These are characters that can be used to represent a variety of other characters. This can be useful for deleting many files, searching for files with specific patterns in their names and more! 

Be very careful when using wildcard character with the command __rm__.  

Three basic and useful wildcards include:  

- `*` - This represents zero or more characters  
- `?` - This represents a single character  
- `[]` - This represents a range of characters

Below are various examples you can run to show wildcards in action.

List all the files and directories in the working directory
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls *
``` 

List all files ending in “.fastq”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls *.fastq
``` 

List all files ending in “.txt”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls *.txt
``` 

List all files with the string “corrected” somewhere in the file name
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls *corrected*
``` 

List all files with the string “corrected” somewhere in the file name and it ends in “fastq”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls *corrected*fastq
``` 

List all files that begin with “sample_2”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_2*
``` 

List all files that begin with “sample_2_”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_2_*
``` 

List the files that begin with “sample_1” and ends with “AAAA.txt”. It may have zero or more characters between these two.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_1_*AAAA.txt
``` 

List the fastq files of samples with a single digit number
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_?_*fastq
``` 

List the txt files of samples with a number in the tens
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_1?*txt
``` 

List the txt files for samples 3,4,5,6 & 7 i.e. 3-7
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_[3-7]*txt
``` 

List the txt files for the non corrected information of samples with single digits.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_?_*[ATGC].txt
``` 

List the corrected txt files for samples with numbers divisible by 10.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls sample_[0-9][0]*corrected.txt
``` 

## Redirection
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/chevron.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Redirection allows you to put the output of a command to a file. The redirect symbol is `>`. Be careful when redirecting as it will overwrite any existing files. To append to the bottom of a file use `>>`.

Below are various examples of redirecting in action.

Create a file called __ecoli.tmp__ containing the text “I am escherichia coli”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo “I am escherichia coli” > ecoli.tmp
``` 

Create a file called __pcryohalolentis.tmp__ containing the text “I am psychrobacter cryohalolentis”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo “I am psychrobacter cryohaloloentis” > pcryohalolentis.tmp
``` 

Create a new file called __bacteria.tmp__ which will contain the text from __ecoli.tmp__ and __pcryohalolentis.tmp__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat *tmp > bacteria.tmp
``` 

Create a file called __vcholerae.tmp__ containing the text “I am not ecoli or pcryohalolentis”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo “I am not ecoli or pcryohalolentis” > vcholerae.tmp
``` 

`cat` the file __vcholerae.tmp__ and redirect it to __bacteria.tmp__.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat vcholerae.tmp > bacteria.tmp
``` 

Look at the contents of __bacteria.tmp__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat bacteria.tmp
``` 

This has removed the ecoli and pcryohalolentis lines. Append the contents of __ecoli.tmp__ and __pcryohalolentis.tmp__ to __bacteria.tmp__ and then check the file
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat ecoli.tmp pcryohalolentis.tmp >> bacteria.tmp
cat bacteria.tmp
``` 

Put information regarding number of lines of all the fastq files into a new file called
__fastq_lines.tmp__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
wc -l *fastq > fastq_lines.tmp
``` 

Now delete all the files that were created in the above examples. Again be very careful about using the `rm` command with wildcards.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
rm *tmp
``` 

## Pipes
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/pipes.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Pipes allow you to put the output of one command to the input of another. For example you could use `grep` to get all the lines with a certain string and pipe the output to `wc` to count the number of lines that have the specific string. 

The pipe symbol is `|`. This is normally found on your keyboard directly left of the Z key. Weirdly the symbol is represented by `|` but split in the middle on some keyboards.

A useful tip when building up longer pipes is to start with a smaller amount of data and check the output of each step as you go. To do this you could use `head` instead of `cat` whilst testing.

Below are various examples of piping in action

Print to screen the second last fastq entry of the file __sample_20_ATAC_corrected.fastq__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat sample_20_ATAC_corrected.fastq | tail -n 8 | head -n 4 
``` 
__Note__: In the above command the `tail` command is working on the output of the `cat` command. Therefore this would not work to get the second last fastq entry of multiple files. For example the following command would print the second last fastq entry of the last fastq file (i.e. __sample_9_AAGA.fastq__ due to file ordering)
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat *fastq | tail -n 8 | head -n 4
``` 

Count the number of lines within all the fastq files
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat *fastq | wc -l
``` 

Count the number of lines within all the fastq files which contain the text “TAG”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat *fastq | grep “TAG” | wc -l
``` 

## Regular expressions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/trex.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
Regular expressions are similar to wildcard characters but more complex and used for commands like `grep` and `sed`.

Below are a basic set of regular expressions:

- `.` : A single character  
- `?` : The preceding character matches 1 or 0 times  
- `*` : The preceding character matches zero or more times  
- `+` : The preceding character matches one or more times  
- `{n}` : The preceding character matches exactly n times  
- `{n,m}` : The preceding character matches n to m times  
- `[AT]` : The character is one of the characters in the brackets  
- `[^CG]` : The character is not one of those in the brackets  
- `[1-7]` : The character is 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7. This works with letters too.  
- `()` : Group several characters into one  
- `|` : Logical OR operator  
- `^` : Matches the beginning of the line  
- `$` : Matches the end of the line  

Below are various examples of regular expressions in action.

Look at the contents of __metadata.txt__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt
``` 

!Print out the lines for the Healthy patients
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | grep “HEALTHY”
``` 

Print out the lines for the IBD patients from Craigavon and Belfast. In the below command `\` is used to allow `|` to be used as an __or__ operator instead of acting as a string to match.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | grep "IBD" | grep "BELFAST\|CRAIGAVON"
``` 

Print out the lines for the Pre information of patients not from Edinburgh or Aberdeen
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | grep "PRE$" | grep -v "ABERDEEN\|EDINBURGH"
``` 

Print out the lines for patients 1,2,3 and 4
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | grep "Patient_[1-4][^0-9]" 
``` 

Print to screen every fastq header of file __sample_15_AACG_corrected.fastq__ 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat sample_15_AACG_corrected.fastq | grep “^@sample”
``` 

In the piping examples we counted the number of lines with the text “TAG” within the fastq files. However this also counted fastq headers due to the name of the samples. Let us use a regular expression to only count the number of sequences within the fastq files that contain “TAG”.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat *fastq | grep “^[^@].*TAG”
``` 

Print to screen every line within the file __sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq__ that has a possible Threonine codon in the forward direction.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep "^[^@].*AC[ACTG]" sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq
``` 

In the above example fastq quality lines are also extracted as some of them also contain the pattern we are searching for. To get around this we can pipe. First grep the fastq quality header (i.e. +), as no other line only contains “+”, and the line before it. Then we can remove lines with only a plus with an invert grep. Finally we can grep for the threonine pattern using only the sequence lines. Let us build this up step by step.  

Print to screen the fastq quality header plus the one line preceding each (i.e. Sequence line) for file __sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq.__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -B 1 “^+$” sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq
``` 

Now pipe this output so it removes the lines with “+” (fastq quality headers) and “--” (separators of each `grep` match provided by grep because of the -B 1 option). 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -B 1 "^+$" sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq | grep -v "+\|--"
``` 

Now from this output, `grep` for the Threonine pattern plus colour each match within the line with the option “__--color__”.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -B 1 "^+$" sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq | grep -v "+\|--" | grep --color "AC[ACTG]"
``` 

Let us repeat the above but add the possibility of the threonine being in the reverse direction.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -B 1 "^+$" sample_3_AAAG_corrected.fastq | grep -v "+\|--" \
| grep --color "AC[ACTG]\|[ACTG]CA"
```

## sed
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/sed.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
This is a complicated yet powerful command that can be used to edit text files quickly and efficiently. The main use is to substitute text with other text. `sed` can be used with regular expressions.

The basic outline of a `sed` substitute command is as below. In the below case `s/` signifies that `sed` will be used for substitution
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sed “s/old_text/new_text/” old_file > new_file
``` 

Below are some examples of sed in action.

Print out a list of all the sample names using the fastq files
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls -1 *[AGTC].fastq | sed "s/.fastq//"
``` 

First print out the contents of the file __metadata.txt__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt
``` 

Print out __metadata.txt__ and change IBD to DISEASE without altering the file
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sed "s/IBD/DISEASE/" metadata.txt
``` 
or
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | sed "s/IBD/DISEASE/"
``` 

`sed` is case sensitive and will by default only replace the first instance it finds within each line.
Print __metadata.txt__ to screen and then change the “P” in “Patient” to “Human_P”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | sed "s/P/Human_P/"
``` 

To replace every instance of the old pattern within each line `g` can be added after the last `/`. This stands for global therefore it changes the command to a global substitute.

Print __metadata.txt__ to screen and change every occurrence of a number to “number”. To get the regular expression meaning of “+” it needs a “__`\`__” before the “+”
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | sed "s/[0-9]\+/number/g"
``` 
The file metadata.txt is tab delimited (i.e. there is a tab between each column. Make a comma separated file containing the information of __metadata.txt__ called __metadata.csv__ (csv = comma separated value). `\t` presents a tab.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat metadata.txt | sed "s/\t/,/g" > metadata.csv
```

## Permissions
All files, directories and programs have permissions. It is important to know about this so you know your read, write and executability permissions for the content within machines.
