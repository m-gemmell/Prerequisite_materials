``` 

## Make a directory
To make a directory the command `mkdir` is used.

For the below examples we will be making heavy use of `ls` so you can hopefully visualise the contents of the directories.

Type in the following commands to make a subdirectory within the __"CGR_Linux"__ directory called __"Chicken"__ then make a subdirectory within __"Chicken"__ called __"Egg"__.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#Change directory to CGR_linux in your home (~)
cd ~/Linux/
#Always good to list contents when you move into a directory
ls
#Make a directory called Chicken in your current directory
mkdir Chicken
#Make a subdirectory of Chicken called Egg
mkdir Chicken/Egg
#List the contents of the Chicken directory
ls Chicken
``` 

__Tip__: You can use the up arrow key to get to previously run commands which you can edit using the right and left keys.

## Moving Directories and Files
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/chicken.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Files and directories can be moved with the `mv` command. This can also be used to change the name of a file or a directory.

__Note__: If you move a file to the path of a file that already exists, the pre existing file will be overwritten.

First ensure your working directory is the __"Linux"__ directory.

Move the __"Chicken"__ directory into the __"3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/"__ directory. This will move the directory and all its contents.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#Before moving list the contents of the the destination directory
ls 3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/
#Also list the contents of the current directory to ensure 
#Chicken is present
ls
#Move Chicken to 3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/
mv Chicken/ 3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/
#List the current directory and destination
ls . 3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/
``` 

Move the Directory __"3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/Chicken/"__ to __"3_chicken_farm/3_2_field"__ and rename it __"Outdoor_Chicken"__.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List the contents of the start directory
ls ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut
#Move the Chicken directory whilst renaming it
mv ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/Chicken/ \
~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/Outdoor_Chicken
#List the contents of the destination directory
ls ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/Outdoor_Chicken
#Move the Chicken directory whilst renaming it
mv ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_1_hut/Chicken/ \
~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/Outdoor_Chicken
#List the contents of the destination directory
ls ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/Outdoor_Chicken
``` 

Move the file __"3_chicken_farm/3_3_supplies/feed.txt"__ to the directory __"3_chicken_farm/3_2_field"__ and rename it __"used_feed.txt"__

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List start directory to see if the feed.txt file exists
ls 3_chicken_farm/3_3_supplies/feed.txt
#Move and rename the feed.txt file
mv 3_chicken_farm/3_3_supplies/feed.txt \
3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/used_feed.txt
#List destination directory
ls 3_chicken_farm/3_2_field/
``` 

## Copying Directories and Files
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/copy.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Files and directories can be copied with the `cp` command. Directories and files can be copied to any directory and given a new name.
Note: If you copy a file to the path of a file that already exists, the pre existing file will be overwritten.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Before running the below commands move into your __"~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/"__ directory.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#Change directory
cd ~/Linux/3_chicken_farm/
#List contents of current directory
ls
```

Copy the file __"3_1_hut/Laid_Egg.txt"__ to the __"3_2_field"__ directory and give it the filename __"Chick.txt"__

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List contents of 3_1_hut
ls 3_1_hut
#Copy Laid_egg to another directory as a new file called Chick.txt
cp 3_1_hut/Laid_Egg.txt 3_2_field/Chick.txt
#List contents of 3_2_field
ls 3_2_field
``` 

Copy the file __"3_2_hut/Chick.txt"__ and give the copy the name __"Chick_2.txt"__

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List contents of 3_2_field
ls 3_2_field
#Copy the Chick.txt file as Chick_2.txt
cp 3_2_field/Chick.txt 3_2_field/Chick_2.txt
#List contents of 3_2_field
ls 3_2_field
``` 

Copy the directory __"3_1_hut"__ to __"3_1_hut_2"__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List contents of current directory
ls
#Copy directory with -r (recursively)
cp -r 3_1_hut 3_1_hut_2
#List contents of current directory
ls
``` 

## Deleting Files and Directories
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/erase.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
To delete files and directories the command `rm` can be used. 

__Important__: This command can be very dangerous. There is no recycle bin on Linux machines so once you delete something it cannot be recovered. Be very careful when deleting files and directories. To avoid major loss try to keep backups of important data and scripts.

Ensure you are in your __"3_chicken_farm/"__ directory

Remove the file __"3_2_field/Chick_2.txt"__
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List contents of 3_2_field
ls 3_2_field
#Remove Chick_2.txt
rm 3_2_field/Chick_2.txt
#List contents of 3_2_field
ls 3_2_field
``` 

Remove the directory __"3_1_hut_2/"__ and its contents
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#List contents of current directory
ls
#Remove directory with -r (recursively)
rm -r  3_1_hut_2
#List contents of current directory
ls
```
